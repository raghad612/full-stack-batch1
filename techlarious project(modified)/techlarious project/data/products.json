The parkour is more fluid than the original (although it can look kind of floaty  occasionally). The graphics are polished and pretty, definately uses the power of the ps5 well. The side characters voice actors don't sound as stiff as in the original however the main character Aiden sounds a lot like Kyle Crane. All together I am enjoying the game and can't wait to continue."

So much content compared to dying light 1, Definitely some bugs here and there but as long as you don't leave the game during an important story mission there aren't many possibilities for save locking bugs, There is the occasional spinning ragdoll or just bodies inside the ground or weird fall damage but once you get a feel for the game all that suddenly becomes irrelevant and you don't care. Metro stations, Windmills, Bandit camps, Airdrops, Quarantine zones, Side quests, Choices, Parkour, Wearable armor that affects stats, Up gradable weapon upgrades, Para-glider, Parkour skills. Incredible amount of content, People complain about the game being buggy or not having guns? These people played on a trashy computer from 12 years ago and played the game for 2 hours only focusing on main story, Do not listen to these people, And support the developers by buying the game and this game is being very rapidly updated removing bugs and adding new content. Definitely buy, Doesn't have to be now can be whenever."

After serving an 18-year prison sentence for a crime he did not commit, Ichiban returns to his hometown only to find it in disarray and his former clan in disarray. The game follows Ichiban’s journey as he seeks to uncover the truth behind the betrayal and restore his honor.Unlike previous entries in the series, which used a beat-'em-up combat system, Yakuza: Like a Dragon features a turn-based combat system, blending traditional RPG elements with the series’ signature storytelling and character development. Players engage in strategic battles, recruit party members, and explore the vibrant city of Yokohama. The game is known for its rich narrative, quirky side quests, and a mix of drama and humor.",

All in all, Ark: Survival Evolved is an incredible game with tons of content and endless replayability. Just be prepared for a bit of a rough ride in the PvP scene, but if you’re up for the challenge, it’s totally worth it!"

The game drops down to 1080p in Performance mode, though it still looks great. The Xbox Series X does slightly better in Quality mode, pushing to 1900p compared to PS5's 1800p. There's not much difference between the two, but if you want the best possible resolution, Xbox edges out just a bit"

The game's massive open world is stunning but demanding, and both consoles handle it well. Ultimately, the experience is solid on either platform, with only minor differences."

Whether it's the procedural soundtrack that subtly weaves in and out, similar to Breath of the Wild, or the eerie calls of alien creatures that either fill you with wonder or dread, the audio experience is truly top-notch. The sound of another ship—possibly another human player—whooshing by adds a whole new layer of immersion, especially when you're wearing headphones. The sound design and the soundtrack are critical to the overall experience."

Despite the updates and improvements, I still can't get into it. Personally, I find Subnautica to be a more engaging survival simulator, particularly because of the lore they've created within that single world. But hey, I hope fans of No Man's Sky are enjoying what it has to offer."
